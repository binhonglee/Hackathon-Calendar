Upcoming Hackathons
===================

## No longer maintained. Personally recommends [Hackalist](https://www.hackalist.org) as an alternative.

This repo tracks upcoming hackathons.

To add a hackathon to this list, please submit an issue or fork this repo and submit a pull request. Keep hackathons organized by start date, end date and then alphabetically.

Inspired by the one made by [japacible](https://github.com/japacible/Hackathon-Calendar) that is no longer maintained, I decided to create a separate one.
